## Installation

### Via npm (Recommended)

Install globally from npm registry:

```bash
npm install -g @taizo-pro/github-discussions-cli
```

After installation, the `gh-discussions` command will be available globally in your terminal.

### Alternative: npx (No Installation Required)

You can also use the tool without installing it globally:

```bash
npx @taizo-pro/github-discussions-cli --help
```

> **Note**: Replace `gh-discussions` with `npx @taizo-pro/github-discussions-cli` in all usage examples if using npx.

## Quick Start

1. **Install the CLI tool**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @taizo-pro/github-discussions-cli
   ```

2. **Set up authentication**:
   ```bash
   gh-discussions config
   ```

3. **Test with a public repository**:
   ```bash
   gh-discussions list microsoft/vscode
   ```

4. **View a specific discussion**:
   ```bash
   gh-discussions show 1 microsoft/vscode
   ```

5. **Try the new search and statistics features**:
   ```bash
   # Search for discussions about bugs
   gh-discussions search "bug" microsoft/vscode
   
   # View repository statistics
   gh-discussions stats microsoft/vscode
   ```

## Setup

### 1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

Before using the CLI, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token with the required permissions:

1. **Sign in to GitHub** and go to your account settings
   
2. **Navigate to Developer Settings**
   - Click your profile picture (top-right corner)
   - Select **Settings**
   - Scroll down and click **Developer settings** (left sidebar)

3. **Access Personal Access Tokens**
   - Click **Personal access tokens**
   - Select **Tokens (classic)** or **Fine-grained tokens**

4. **Create New Token (Classic)**
   - Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (classic)**
   - Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Discussions CLI")
   - Set expiration (recommended: 90 days or custom)
   - **Select the following scopes** (⚠️ Important - choose based on your needs):

   **For Private Repositories:**
   - ✅ **repo** (Full control of private repositories)
   - This single scope provides access to discussions in private repositories

   **For Public Repositories Only:**
   - ✅ **public_repo** (Access public repositories)
   - This is sufficient if you only work with public repository discussions

   **Additional Recommended Scopes:**
   - ✅ **read:user** (Read user profile data) - For displaying author information
   - ✅ **user:email** (Access user email) - For proper attribution

   ⚠️ **Security Note**: Only select `repo` if you need private repository access, as it grants broad permissions.

   - Click **Generate token**

5. **Alternative: Fine-grained Personal Access Tokens (Beta)**
   If you prefer more granular control, you can use fine-grained tokens:
   
   - Click **Generate new token** → **Generate new token (beta)**
   - **Resource owner**: Select your account or organization
   - **Repository access**: Choose specific repositories or "All repositories"
   - **Repository permissions**:
     - ✅ **Discussions**: Read and write
     - ✅ **Metadata**: Read (required)
     - ✅ **Contents** (if creating discussions with file references): Read
   
   📝 **Note**: Fine-grained tokens are currently in beta and may have limitations.

6. **Copy Your Token**
   - **⚠️ Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again
   - Store it securely (you'll need it in the next step)

### 2. Configure the CLI Tool

Run the interactive configuration setup:

```bash
gh-discussions config
```

The setup will prompt you for:
- **GitHub Token**: Paste the token you created above
- **Default Repository**: Enter a repo in `owner/repository` format (optional)
- **Output Format**: Choose table, json, or markdown (default: table)

### 3. Verify Setup

Test your configuration:

```bash
# Show current configuration
gh-discussions config --show

# Test by listing discussions (replace with actual repo)
gh-discussions list owner/repository
```

### Troubleshooting Token Issues

#### Common Error Messages and Solutions:

**❌ "Bad credentials" / "Invalid token"**
- Double-check that you copied the token correctly (no extra spaces)
- Ensure the token hasn't expired
- Try generating a new token

**❌ "Resource not accessible by integration"**
- For **private repositories**: You need the `repo` scope (classic tokens)
- For **public repositories**: `public_repo` scope is sufficient
- For **fine-grained tokens**: Ensure "Discussions" permission is set to "Read and write"

**❌ "Not Found" errors**
- Verify the repository exists and you have access to it
- Check that Discussions are enabled in the repository settings
- Ensure your token has access to the specific repository (for fine-grained tokens)

**❌ "API rate limit exceeded"**
- Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually 1 hour)
- Authenticated requests have higher rate limits than anonymous ones

#### Permission Requirements by Action:

| Action | Classic Token Scope | Fine-grained Permission |
|--------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| List discussions | `public_repo` (public) / `repo` (private) | Discussions: Read |
| View discussion details | `public_repo` (public) / `repo` (private) | Discussions: Read |
| Create comments | `public_repo` (public) / `repo` (private) | Discussions: Write |
| Create discussions | `public_repo` (public) / `repo` (private) | Discussions: Write |

#### Quick Setup Guide:

**🎯 Most Common Setup (Public + Private repos):**
```
✅ repo (Full control of private repositories)
```

**🎯 Public Repositories Only:**
```
✅ public_repo (Access public repositories)
✅ read:user (Read user profile data)
```

**🎯 Fine-grained Token (Recommended for specific repos):**
```
Repository permissions:
✅ Discussions: Read and write
✅ Metadata: Read
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Never share your token** or commit it to version control
- **Use the minimum required scopes** for your use case
- **Set reasonable expiration dates** and rotate tokens regularly
- **Revoke unused tokens** from GitHub settings
- **Use fine-grained tokens** when possible for better security
- **Test with public repositories first** before granting private repo access
